# Welcome to Vue with TypeScript and Tailwind!

If you are using VSCode, be sure to install the Tailwind Intelisense plugin.

Also, add Vue to your Tailwind supported languages in order to get autocomplete to work in your `.vue` files:

In `settings.json`:

```
{
"tailwindCSS.includeLanguages": {
    "vue": "html",
    "html": "html"
  },
}
```

## Project setup

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

After running `npm run serve` visit `localhost:8080` and you should see this:
